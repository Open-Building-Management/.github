open building management is about **long term** data management solutions for buildings and houses

a solution is emoncms, a timeseries which is like influxdb and which exposes an HTTP API. You can use the **emoncms standalone docker** which can also acts as a home assistant addon. It is surely the easiest way to start with emoncms. In a few seconds, you will have all the tools available without the need to go into the configuration details.

See :
- [emoncms-docker](https://emoncms-docker.github.io) for an introduction
- [advanced tips and use cases](https://github.com/Open-Building-Management/emoncms/discussions)

I've also crafted a minimal [emontx sniffer addon](https://github.com/Open-Building-Management/emontx_sniffer) for home assistant which I originally thought to be used in combination with the emoncms addon. Anyway, it can act as a standalone tool, storing datas in the home assistant database only. see https://github.com/Open-Building-Management/emontx_sniffer/issues/1

I am also discovering grafana...

I've tried to use reinforcement learning to create an energy building model called [EnergyGym](https://github.com/Open-Building-Management/EnergyGym) but it is really difficult to train a portable model that adapts correctly to various building types, ie when isolation or inertia are different than the ones used during training. In RL everything relies on a the (not easy) design of a reward, here it is a sparse reward that balance confort and energy savings. The lack of real world classified datas led me to use synthetic datas generated by a simple RC model and to practise off policy training like deep Q network. Results are not so bad on buildings with little isolation and some inertia. When trying to train a single agent on random types of buildings, things are really not convincing.
